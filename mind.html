    <p>The Mind Stone allows the user to read others' minds, dreams, and enhances the user's mental abilities. It's first appearence was in the Avengers. It was disguised as Loki's scepter. It was in the center of the scepter. At first no one knew it was there until Age of Ultron. Ultron was the first one on Earth to know that the scepter contained the Mind Stone. After the events of the Avengers, Hydra had obtained the Mind Stone to create weapons of mass destruction. Then the Maximoff twins volunteered to be experimented on by the Mind Stone. Pietro Maximoff gained the power of super speed. While his sister Wanda Maximoff gained the power of magic and telekinesis. With the power she had gained, she had the power to destroy an Infinity Stone. During the events of Age of Ultron Tony and Bruce decidec to pur J.A.R.V.I.S (Tony's A.I.) into a Ultron's "son". Vision/IRL J.A.R.V.I.S, the new Avenger used and lived off of the Mind Stone. Until Thanos came to Wakanda to rip the Mind Stone out of Vision's head. But it's a theory that when Thanos had the mind stone before he gave it to Loki, Thanos accquired all the knowledge in the universe. That is hinted at when he said "You're not the only one cursed with knowledge." in Infinity War. He knew about everything about the Avengers. But the stone happened to not know about Captain Marvel. But there is still one question remaining. And this might be the most important question in all of the MCU, WHY DID THANOS, THE MAD TITAN, GIVE LOKI ONE OF THE INFINITY STONES!?!?</p>
